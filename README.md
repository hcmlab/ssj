### Social Signal Processing for Android

SSJ is an extensible android framework for social signal processing in an out of lab envirnoment. It packages common signal processing tools in a flexible, mobile friendly Java library which can be easily integrated into Android Apps.

### Features
* Realtime signal processing using independent components as processing steps in a pipeline
* Synchronized data streams
* Support for most standard android sensors e.g. Camera, Microphone, Acceleration, GPS
* Support for external sensors via bluetooth e.g. Microsoft Band 2, Myo, Angel Sensor, Empatica
* Advanced signal processing functionality, including machine learning approaches (Neural Networks, SVM, NaiveBayes)
* On device model training capabilities (batch and online learning)
* I/O functionality: local storage, sockets, bluetooth
* Energy efficient processing thanks to advanced sleep state management and support for discrete data propagation
* Live data visualization (using <a href="https://github.com/hcmlab/GraphView">GraphView</a> library)
* SSJ Creator: Android App for building, editing and running SSJ pipelines without writing a single line of code


### Download

### About
The Social Signal Processing for Java/Android (SSJ) framework is being developed at the Lab for Human Centered Multimedia of the University of Augsburg. The authors of the framework are: <a href="https://www.informatik.uni-augsburg.de/lehrstuehle/hcm/staff/_formerstaff/damian/">Ionut Damian</a>, <a href="https://www.informatik.uni-augsburg.de/lehrstuehle/hcm/staff/dietz/">Michael Dietz</a>, <a href="https://www.informatik.uni-augsburg.de/lehrstuehle/hcm/staff/_formerstudents/gaibler/">Frank Gaibler</a>, <a href="https://www.informatik.uni-augsburg.de/lehrstuehle/hcm/staff/_formerstudents/langerenken/">Daniel Langerenken</a>, <a href="https://www.informatik.uni-augsburg.de/lehrstuehle/hcm/staff/flutura/">Simon Flutura</a>, <a href="https://www.informatik.uni-augsburg.de/lehrstuehle/hcm/staff/_formerstudents/krumins/">Vitalijs Krumins</a>, Antonio Grieco.

SSJ has been inspired by the SSI (http://openssi.net) framework. SSJ is not a one-to-one port of SSI to Java, it is an approximation. Nevertheless, it borrows a lot of programming patterns from SSI and preserves the same vision for signal processing which makes SSI great. It than packages everything in a flexible, mobile friendly Java library which can be easily integrated into Android Apps.
